# Addon repository help
---
This guide is created to help you when running your own addon; with things like setting up a repository for automatic updates. 

A lot of people struggle with setting these up; but as you'll see they are actually very simple to manage and setup. There are a number of very good YouTube videos and I recommend that you check any out that you find; I won't link any because I'm not affiliated with them. 

Things you'll need:

* A website hosting account; or somewhere you can upload files that are visible using a web browser. I recommend AntiSocial Hosting if you need hosting. *(NB. It is my own company so I would recommend it - but others will also recommend)* - Just to be completely transparent, you can also use github (this website) but expect them to close your account.
* A decent text editor; I use [atom.io](https://atom.io) on Mac but you can use [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or just another text editor; including Vi(m) for Linux
* Python installed on your machine or at least the ability to run Python scripts
* Kodi - of course
* The ability to run the command md5sum. Windows: [Download](http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/md5sums/) / Mac: Use brew to install (brew install md5sum)
