Things to change:
1) addon id; this should be unique to you and not ideally used by anyone else to safeguard any conflicts within Kodi
2) name; Change this the actual name of your repository; you can use colours in this Name
3) version; given that this is your first build, you can leave this as 0.0.1 but if you change it once loaded, increment this value.
4) provider-name; this is your name; your unique name that shows people who created it
